Challenge Writeup: The Mutating Flag
Challenge Overview
The page contains dozens of HTML comments formatted like lactf{fake_flag}. According to the challenge description, the real flag is mutating, which implies there is a script running in the background that either:

Changes the text of one specific comment periodically.

Cycles which comment contains the "real" flag format.

Technical Analysis
1. The Distraction (Static Fakes)
Looking at the source code, there are numerous decoys:

lactf{not_here}

lactf{you_wish}

lactf{red_herring}

lactf{fake_flag}

Trying to manually copy-paste these is a losing game, especially if the real flag is being injected or modified by JavaScript every few milliseconds.

2. The Strategy (Automated Detection)
Since the flag "mutates," we need a way to monitor the DOM (Document Object Model) for changes or to filter through all comments to find one that doesn't match the "fake" patterns.

Solution Steps
Step 1: Identify the Mutation
Open your Browser Console (F12). If the flag is truly mutating, there is likely a setInterval or requestAnimationFrame function running. Instead of reverse-engineering the script, we can simply query all comments.

Step 2: Use a Script to "Catch" the Flag
Since we know the flag format is lactf{...}, we can write a small snippet to extract all comments and filter out the obvious fakes. Run this in your console:

JavaScript

// Function to find all comments in the document
function findFlag() {
    const iterator = document.createNodeIterator(document, NodeFilter.SHOW_COMMENT);
    let currentNode;
    while (currentNode = iterator.nextNode()) {
        const text = currentNode.nodeValue.trim();
        // Filter out known fake patterns to find the outlier
        if (text.includes("lactf{") && 
            !text.includes("fake") && 
            !text.includes("not_here") && 
            !text.includes("try_again") &&
            !text.includes("wrong")) {
            console.log("%c Flag Found: " + text, "color: #00ff00; font-weight: bold;");
        }
    }
}

// Run it once, or set an interval if it changes too fast
setInterval(findFlag, 100);
Step 3: Monitor the "Mutation"
If the script above doesn't yield a result immediately, the real flag might be hidden in a way that it only appears for a single frame. The setInterval at 100ms will "poll" the DOM and print the flag to your console the moment it appears.

Conclusion
In "Mutating" challenges, the UI is usually a smokescreen. By using a NodeIterator or TreeWalker in the console, you can bypass the visual noise and programmatically "catch" the data as it changes in the background.
